      <p>My name is JéRóme Yáng. I'm made in Taiwan. Tainan, southern city to north Taipei. I earn my Computer Science long time ago when there was no cellphone and network created yet. My  computer knowledges are out of date so I come here to start-over. In my ages time, Computer Science used to spell as CS, now it's spelled as CIS. </p>
	<p>I'm designing 21 or 22 websites for my videos of dance' musical projects such as Blue Green Screen Production' Multi-Media EBook'4 in 1 Mv', 3D Comicsetc to demo and get the job in Google.com as the Online App Developer for me and my coodinators. </p>
